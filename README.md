# Satik: Platform for Decentralised Brand Deals

Satik helps create on-chain contracts between influencers and brands where influencers are paid for both views and sales they bring for brands, on the fly. 

In the present, Brand deals are based on prediction of how a content is going to perform which can be risky for the brand. And influencers don’t have any way to truthfully know the sales they bring to a brand, unless they are told by the brand, and it’s in the brand's interest to downplay the sales.

Satik helps brands reward influencers on both visibility and sales. Satik can help brands transparently reward influencers for sales they bring. Influencers can also be transparently rewarded in Solana for views they garner for the agreed content. 

This can help smaller and foreign content creators and brands collaborate without trusting each other explicitly.
